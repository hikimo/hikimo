Hi, I'm **Rangga Prastio**👋 
a Senior Frontend Engineer with a full-stack foundation and a love for clean code, fast interfaces, and the occasional caffeine-fueled refactor.

Since 2018, I’ve been building web and mobile apps that don’t just work, they work well. 
My journey started in full-stack development, but I quickly discovered that the frontend is where performance, c
reativity, and user experience collide, and I’ve been hooked ever since.

These days, I specialize in React, Vue, Angular, and React Native, but I still keep my backend toolkit sharp with Laravel, Express, and NestJS. (Yes, I can still write a solid REST API or debug that odd PHP issue. You're welcome.)

What I bring to the table:
- A solid mix of **technical depth** and **product thinking**
- A bias for **shipping fast without breaking things**
- Fluent collaboration across design, frontend, and backend teams
- A sense of humor that pairs well with tight deadlines and code reviews

Whether you need a frontend lead who can own the user experience or a dev who can translate chaos into components, I’m your person.
**Currently open to impactful work freelance, full-time, or just geeking out on cool side projects.**
